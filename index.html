            Combining analog synths, live winds instruments, sansula and areal delay, Axel Rigaud (a.k.a. Le Tarsier) constructs overwhelming soundscapes in real time, plunging his audiences into a hybrid musical universe where electronic and acoustic mediums mesh as one. 
            Exploring the very limits of what a single musician can do alone, his aim is make each performance an opportunity for risk by never relying on pre-recorded audio. This approach allows every performance to vary noticeably from one venue to the next.<a href="http://www.jazzmagazine.com/index.php/le-jazz-live/1-le-jazz-live/892-concert-electronique-de-salon-chez-axel-rigaud">Concert Review (french)     </a>

            This EP has been made between December 2014 and April 2015. Between each tracks you will hear the same crowd sound transitioning from one tune to another. This sound has been recorded in Gare de l&apos;Est (Paris), where I used to wait a lot during the days I started composing this EP.
            I hope you will enjoy.
